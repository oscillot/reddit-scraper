Handle the following imgur error scenario:

Post says:

http://imgur.com/gallery/jsCHztU

Image should resolve to

http://i.imgur.com/jsCHztU.[jpg|png|bmp|gif]

But redirects to:

http://i.imgur.com/removed.png

Scraper gets a 404 on the gallerypage, which I guess is fine, actually,
but think about it for a bit and see what you can do.
